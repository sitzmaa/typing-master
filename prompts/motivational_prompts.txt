The only way to do great work is to love what you do.

Believe you can and youâ€™re halfway there.

Success is not final, failure is not fatal: It is the courage to continue that counts.

The only limit to our realization of tomorrow is our doubts of today.

Hardships often prepare ordinary people for an extraordinary destiny.
